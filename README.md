#SGAS - Super Generic Arena Shooter
##An example game to teach the basics of libgdx

SGAS is a top-down shooter, in the style of an arcade twin-stick shooter, but controlled with the WASD keys and the mouse instead of sticks or something.  It is not meant to be some paradigm of creativity and game design. It does not pretend to bring anything new or original to the table.  It simply aims to present the basics of game programming using libgdx (for desktop deployment) using familiar concepts and familiar gameplay.
